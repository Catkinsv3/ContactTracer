# ContactTracer

A COVID-19 contact tracing model.
Given any list of tuples (Person A, Person B, Contact Time), we can perform highly efficient contact tracing using our internal graph data structure and graph traversals.

Extensive testing was done to ensure robustness, covering all aspects of functionality including edge cases.

See Task.pdf for detailed outline of functionality.
